**Delphi Object directly to a Json string in a REST Client Example**

This blog is the result of an Android REST Client project which was used to
parse sensitive multiple email fieldsâ€™ information to Json. Thereafter encrypted
and sent as base64 code to a HTTPS REST Server using SSL. The REST Service uses
an API key verification process.

To find out more, check out my blog on this which offers further in-depth
explanation on how to use the code.

Check out the gif below which demonstrates the sending of an email to a client
via the REST Server. After receiving the REST post call. Note that this is
demonstrated using the Xampp and a PhP REST server operating in a localhost
environment.
